# Map for rainforest sponsors

https://github.com/atomas18/map.git

This is the home of development for an interactive map within the site  http://regenwald-institut.de.

Goals:
- indicate the area of rainforest for which sponsorships are available
- highlight plots for which a sponsorhip exists
- on selection, show the name of the sponsor and a link to google maps

It is based on Leaflet JS and Turf JS and Mapbox. Feel free to browse https://atomas18.github.io/map/, but be nice as the number of mapbox requests is limited.
